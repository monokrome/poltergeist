Developing
----------

To develop on this project you need to install GLP. If you have
./node_modules/.bin in your $PATH environment variable then you can skip this
step. Otherwise, install it globally with:

    npm install -g glp

Now install dependencies with npm and bower:

    bower install
    npm install

You should be able to run a simple static server after installing dependencies.

    glp server

Soure code is located in the `src` directory. Check out the `glp.yml` file to
see how this project is configured. For more information on GLP, visit the
[README on the GLP repository][glp].
